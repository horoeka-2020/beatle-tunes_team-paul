## Project Aim:
To build a responsive web application that will utilise the technology learnings from this week to find and display artist/songs based on selected musical genres

## Project Theme:
Music

## Decision making method:
Democracy

## Scoping techniques used:
1. Identify user stories
2. Rank each story as either MUST, SHOULD or COULD
3. Estimate each story with a finger of five asssessment.  If greater or equal to four needs to be broken down more

## Retrospective results:
### Things that did not go well:
1. Did not really stick to roles (as found it was not overly necessary)
2. Too loose with timeboxing
3. Too quiet when static
4. Could have had clearer outline for design

### Things that went well:
1. When on a roll communication was great
2. Good communication around pull/push
3. Achieved MVP in good time
4. Completed some stretch goals
5. Completing data setup the night before
6. Kenneth's styling - very slick
7. Planning session(s)
8. Stand-ups
9. Super positive vibes in team =)

### Things to focus on for next time:
1. Be more concious of roles
2. Be more active with timeboxing
3. Keep communication consistent throughout project
